# Rust-IL-Writer

I am just writing an IL writer for Rust so I can use it on my future programming languages.

I do plan to make it even easier to use, right now it's on github so I don't lose source or anything like that.

This does use 'Microsoft (R) .NET Framework IL Assembler' to assemble the il output.

For an example check src/main.rs and for output in the root find out.il
